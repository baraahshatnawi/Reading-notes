# Operators :

**An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.**

**JavaScript has the following types of operators:**

**1. Assignment operators.**

  *_-The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable._*

  *_-The += assignment operator adds a value to a variable._*

  *_-The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable._*

  -The *= assignment operator multiplies a variable.

  *_-The /= assignment divides a variable._*

  *_-The %= assignment operator assigns a remainder to a variable._*

**2. Arithmatic operators.**

  *_-The addition operator (+) adds numbers._*

  *_-The multiplication operator multiplies numbers._*

  *_-The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers._*

  *_-The division operator (/) divides numbers._*

  *_-The increment operator (++) increments numbers._*

  *_-The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers._*

  *_-The exponentiation operator raises the first operand to the power of the second operand._*

  *_-Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression._*

  *_-The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder._*

**3.Bitwise operators.**

  *_-Bitwise AND : Returns a True in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are True._*

  *_-Bitwise OR : Returns a Flase in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are False._*

**4.Comparsion Operator.**

  *_-Equal (==)	Returns true if the operands are equal._*

  *_-Not equal (!=)	Returns true if the operands are not equal._*

  *_-Strict equal (===)	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type._*

  *_-Strict not equal (!==)	Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type._*

  *_-Greater than (>)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand._*

  *_-Greater than or equal (>=)	Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand._*

  *_-Less than (<)	Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand._*

  *_-Less than or equal (<=)	Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand._*

**5. String operators.**

  *_-In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings._*

  *_-The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings._*

 # Loops 

  ***Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.***

  ***Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.***

 ### for Loop 

 **Controls the flow of the statement.**

***The for loop has the following syntax:***

***for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){ // code block to be executed }***

  *_-Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block._*

  *_-Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block._*

  *_Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed._*

### while Loop

 **The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.**

***The while loop has the following syntax:***

 ***while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}***
