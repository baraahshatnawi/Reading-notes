# Cascading Style sheets 

***-CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.***

***-CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.***

***-CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.***

***-CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.***

***CSS Example:***

**body {**

**background-color: lightblue;**

**}**

**h1 {**

**color: white;**

**text-align: center;**

**}**

**p {**

**font-family: verdana;**
**font-size: 20px;**

**}**

# CSS Syntax 

***A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.***

*_-The selector points to the HTML element you want to style._*

*_-The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons._*

*_-Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon._*

*_-Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces._*

# CSS Selectors 

***CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.***

 **-1. The CSS element Selector**

*_The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name._*

**2. The CSS id Selector**

*_The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element._*

**3. The CSS class Selector**

*_The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute._*

**4. The CSS Universal Selector**

*_The universal selector selects all HTML elements on the page._*

**5. The CSS Grouping Selector**

*_The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions._*

# Three Ways to Insert CSS

***There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:***

**1. External CSS.**

*_With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!_*

*_Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the < link > element, inside the head section._*

**2. Internal CSS.**

*_An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style._*

*_The internal style is defined inside the < style > element, inside the head section._*

**3. Inline CSS.**

*_An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element._*

*_To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property._*
